        Enable secure payments (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, or Bancontact).
    Appeals Management:
        File appeals with supporting evidence and track status.
    Violation Statistics:
        Interactive heatmap showing areas with the most violations.

    Route Optimization:
        AI-powered route optimization for garbage trucks to reduce travel time and fuel costs.

3. Administrative Tasks (Commune Services)

    Task Categories: Citizens can choose from common administrative services such as:
        Creation of Documents: Request birth certificates, marriage licenses, or proof of residence.
        Dossier Status Check: Track the progress of applications (e.g., residency permits).
        FAQs: Get instant answers to simple questions using an AI-powered chatbot (e.g., "What documents are needed for a passport?").
    Appointment Scheduling:
        Book appointments for in-person visits to the commune.
        Receive email or SMS reminders.
    Document Upload:
        Allow citizens to upload required documents directly through the portal.

    Analytics:
        Predict waste collection patterns, track fine trends, and monitor citizen feedback sentiment.
    User Management:
